review: You're done

Notice red in coverage report. Remove from coverage the driver code.

When working with live data, keep in mind that data can change. Number of
reviews may not be the same later on. So, don't hard code review count.
Instead check for a value > 0 or a value > current value.

After these few changes, you're done.

review: check coverage report.

Look for red in the coverage report, remove code not being tested.

Very nice progress, good series of tests.

Don't write code without first writing a failing test. Then write code
minimally to pass the tests.

review: revisit the design steps.

Read into the test to see if it burdens the user of the class.
See suggestions in code.

review: Very nice progress

Good progression of tests leading the design.

Reduce clutter in code, modularize to improve readability.

review: nice progress, revisit dealing with error

For the failure case, capture the details of failure.

Very nice design decisions. Improve code readability, modularize to
make it easy to quickly see what's going on.

review: postpone to last responsible moment

Good tests.

Some of the tests and code are coming in earlier than needed. See suggestions.

review: excellent start

Include code coverage in the build (see assign1 build file).

Very nice start.

Don't do null checks if methods.

Move on to the next step.
